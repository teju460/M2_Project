SWOT ANALYSIS:

       STRENGHT:

                 o   LEDâ€™s are simple to use and are extremely energy efficient and Also, money and energy is saved in maintenance and replacement costs due to the long                      LED lifespan. 
                 o   whereas in atmega controller the processors are easy to use ,with the usage of 8bit and 16bit instead of 32/64bit which are more complex .

   WEAKNESS:

                 o  LEDs must be supplied with the voltage above the threshold and a current below the rating. This can involve series resistors or current-regulated                         power supplies. 
                 o Lacks performance compared to higher bit microcontrollers.
