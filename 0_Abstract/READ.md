OBJECTIVE:

      The main objective of this project is to analyse the blinking of two LED’s using ATMEGA328 microcontroller.

INTRODUCTION:

     LEDs are small, powerful lights that are used in many different applications. To start off, by  blinking an LED, by using ATMEGA328 microcontroller.

WORKING:
                o First, we will connect the 2 LED’s to the ATmega328 microcontroller. 
                o Then, we will make the 2 LED’s to blink with an interval of 1 second. 
                o It means, initially the 1st LED alone will glow and on the next second, it will turn off and the 2nd  one will glow.
                o  This process continues forever and in this way LEDs blinks continuously.

SWOT ANALYSIS:

    STRENGHT:

                 o   LED’s are simple to use and are extremely energy efficient and Also, money and energy is saved in maintenance and replacement costs due to the                          long LED lifespan. 
                 o   whereas in atmega controller the processors are easy to use ,with the usage of 8bit and 16bit instead of 32/64bit which are more complex .

   WEAKNESS:

                 o  LEDs must be supplied with the voltage above the threshold and a current below the rating. This can involve series resistors or current-regulated                       power supplies. 
                 o Lacks performance compared to higher bit microcontrollers.
