                                           BLINKING OF TWO LED’S

OBJECTIVE:
      The main objective of this project is to analyse the blinking of two LED’s using ATMEGA328 microcontroller.

INTRODUCTION:
     LEDs are small, powerful lights that are used in many different applications. To start off, by  blinking an LED, by using ATMEGA328 microcontroller.

WORKING:
                o First, we will connect the 2 LED’s to the ATmega328 microcontroller. 
                o Then, we will make the 2 LED’s to blink with an interval of 1 second. 
                o It means, initially the 1st LED alone will glow and on the next second, it will turn off and the 2nd  one will glow.
                o  This process continues forever and in this way LEDs blinks continuously.
